# FINAL-PROJECT-PA-_0252789_0252760
This repository contains the codes of our final project of the subject: Advanced Programming. All of these codes are related to the topic: Oriented POO in c++.
"ClassFriend01" is bassically a  code that explains the use of the friend functions, an important topic of POO. it has some funny functions, constructors and objects thta explains the topic really clear. 
"Zoo_POO_02" is a code that just express how do the classes, constructors, objects and functions works at the POO. it is a really interactive code with an animal thematic that prints some animal behaviour. 
"Herencia_MÃºltiple_03" is an extense code that mainly expresses how this kinf of herence works. With a thematic of pets (Cats and dogs) it contains two parent classes and two child classes with their respective atributs, methods, objects, etc. 
There is no much new on this code, in the main we create the objects and call the functions. Something to highlight is the use of the long range operator.
"MacrosyD04" are a group of codes, some of the in .h format, that expresses the topic related to Macros and directives of processing. It is bassicaly a group of classes (one by each file, with .h extension) with their respectives attributes, methods, ect. that also have some proccesing directives, such as #include, #ifndef, #define and helps to interconect the files to the main class. Where we create the objects, call the functions, and also create a macro on each of the objects.
